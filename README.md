# Host-an-Informatician: You Lab

## Meetings

Meeting notes are in [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l3umC6dMKbQ9yhKVcssjCYWQbgJ_q2cmqecpPlvqIEA/edit#heading=h.f12sxqxyhil7)

## Summary of initial meeting 

- Investigators are analyzing microscopy data. 30-50GB per experiment, some investigators analyzing 3 experiments per week
- Analysis is running on laptop computers - some personal assets
- Data storage is also on laptop computers or personal assets
- Data backup/archival does not seem robust, stored on consumer-grade hard drives
- Cost of storage resources is a concern
- Analysis code is primarily written in matlab
- Some past attempts to use cluster yielded differing results
- Unknown if version control is used
- Questions about how to access cluster or other resources
- Researchers present are not acquring/analzying human subject data

## Informatics support opportunities

- Data storage on GCB resources
- Analysis on GCB resources
- Version control for analysis processes
- Provide training on existing infrastructure

## Need to identify

- Storage/retention/archival requirements / possibilities. Do we support long-term storage?
- compute memory/processor resources.
- hosts to use? hardac? dscr? new vms? containers?
- coding practices, versioning, where code lives?
- storage to use? existing nfs storage? how to stage data?
- Candidate for us to transfer analysis

## Next steps

- Answer questions internally (many are sysadmin and policy related)
- Proposal to individual within lab to take over analysis
- Provide details on how to access resources (e.g. HARDAC)
